# AI Learns To Play Snake! Reinforcement Learning With PyTorch and Pygame

In this Python Reinforcement Learning Project I build an AI and then teach it to play Snake! I build everything using Pygame and PyTorch.

Key steps:

- Implement the Snake game.
- Implement the agent that controls the game.
- Implement the neural network to predict the moves and train it.

## Dependencies

I have used Anaconda to create the python env

```
conda create -n pygame_env python=3.7
```

I used pyGame to create the game environment

```
pip install pygame
```

I used pyTorch to create the model

```
pip install torch torchvision
```

Extra deps:

```
pip install matplotlib ipython
```
